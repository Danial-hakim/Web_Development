        You are to think up seven 4-or-more letter words that made from the letters contained within the sourceword,
        ensuring that:

    <p>
        <pre>
            1.Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.
            2.You haven't reused any letter more times that it appears in the sourceword. 
            3.Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a "real" word).
            4.The words all have four letters or more.
            5.There are no duplicate words.
            6.None of the seven words is the source word.
